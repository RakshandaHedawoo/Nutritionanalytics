The U.S. Department of Agriculture FoodData Central (FDC) provides a comprehensive database of nutrient and food component data, encompassing two primary data types: Foundation Foods and SR Legacy. Foundation Foods represents current analytical data while SR Legacy offers historical comprehensive values, predating 2019. This project aims to unravel the evolution of day-to-day food components and identify disparities between the datasets. Our focus on common fundamental food categories, such as dairy and egg products, fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereal grains, and baked products, was driven by their common presence in diets worldwide. These categories were selected based on their nutritional significance, widespread consumption, and essential role in providing vital nutrients and energy for maintaining overall health. First, we started with preparing the data and addressing missing values, to ensure the integrity of our analysis. Further our first analysis comprises a comparative examination of SR and FF data, that revealed significant variance over time in key categories, shedding light on the dynamic nature of day-to-day food components. Delving deeper, we identified the underlying nutrients driving these changes, providing valuable insights into dietary patterns and nutritional shifts. Our findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the evolving landscape of day-to-day food components and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions for dietary planning and public health initiatives. Through our exploration of USDA FoodData Central, we unveil valuable insights that pave the way for a healthier future, grounded in an understanding of the fundamental elements of our diets.
